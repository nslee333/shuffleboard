        <H2>
            Horse Collar shuffleboard games are played one-on-one or with two
            or more teams of two players. In this game, team partners shoot
            from the same end of the board, while in a one-on-one match they
            shoot opposite of each other. Each player or team uses one set of
            colored pucks (four for teams of two, eight for one-on-one) to make
            their attempts at scoring. Depending on the number of players,
            teams may need to alternate ends as the frames change.

            Frames continue on until one player or team has scored the magic
            number of 51 points. This score doesn’t necessarily win you the game,
            as the winner must have the last shot in their hand (“the hammer”) in
            order to claim victory for him or herself. Every player or team gets
            to finish each frame and the highest score is the winner. During gameplay,
            no players are allowed to leave their position to check a weight to
            see what their partner or opponent has thrown.

        <h2>
            With the object being to score the most points, the concept of throwing
            shuffleboard pucks in Horse Collar is somewhat simple. It’s just getting
            your pucks to go where you want that is complicated. Before a player or
            team can score any points at all, at least one puck must be a three-pointer
            or more. From there the scoring breaks down slightly different that the
            typical shuffleboard game.

        <h1 align="Center">How To Keep Score In Horse Collar</h1>
        <H2>
            Any pucks past the designated foul line are eligible to be counted when
            scoring in Horse Collar as long as there is one puck in the three-point
            section. The traditional scoring for most shuffleboards game is in play
            when it comes to pucks that land within the one-point, two-point and
            three-point section. However, “hangers,” or pucks that hang over the
            edge of the board in three-point territory, are worth more points.
