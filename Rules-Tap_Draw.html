        <h1 align="Center">Basic Tap & Draw Gameplay</h1>
        <H2>
            This is an excellent game for a beginner who is opposing a
            skilled player. The object of the game is to shuffle your
            pucks up to the farthest scoring position on the board,
            without knocking ANY pucks off the board. In this game,
            it is an advantage to shuffle the first puck. A game is
            NOT complete until the player or team, which has been
            shooting last, has taken its last turn at the board, even
            though the player or team shooting first has already scored
            51 points or more. If both teams go over 51 points, the one
            with the final highest score is the winner.

        <h1 align="Center">How To Throw Shuffleboard Pucks In Tap & Draw</h1>
        <H2>
            Pucks are shuffled alternately, until all eight have been shuffled,
            completing one round of play. You may try to tap your own puck,
            with the purpose of sending it farther up the board, but if you
            knock your own puck off the board, it stays off and out of play.
            If you knock your opponent’s puck off the board, your puck will
            be removed from play, and your opponent’s puck will be replaced
            on the board in its original position. If you knock your opponent’s
            puck off the board, and at the same time advance one or more of your
            own pucks to higher scoring areas, your pucks must be returned to
            their original positions, your opponent’s pucks replaced in their
            original position, and your shooting puck must be removed from the
            board. If you tap any of your opponent’s pucks so that they advance,
            they remain in the better scoring position.

        <h2>
            If playing like traditional Knock Off, scoring is to 15 points and
            score counting is identical to Knock Off, in which a puck scores
            one-point if it is located between the designated foul line and
            the two-line, two or three points if the puck is completely across
            the two or three lines, and four if you have a mythical hanger.
        </h2>

        <br>
        <h2>
            If playing like Horse Collar, scoring is to 51 points and scoring
            rules are the same as those in Horse Collar. This means no scoring
            at all unless there is at least one puck completely in the three-point
            zone, 13-point zone, or 26-point zone. Once the first points have
            been scored, traditional shuffleboard rules apply, except for the
            larger points awarded to all pucks overhanging the board at the far
            end, for 13 points, and all pucks overhanging the left- and/or
            right-hand corner of the board, for 26 points.
