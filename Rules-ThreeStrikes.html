        <br />
        <H2>
            Each person will shoot 4 pucks - 3 of one color, and 1 of the other
            color. The 3 same colored (red) pucks are your "Point" pucks and the
            single color puck (blue) is your "Multiplier". The multiplier does
            not count for any points and can be thrown at any time during your
            turn. Players must shoot all pucks past the long foul line to count.
            All point values are the same as regular knock-off play (hanger is
            4 points). The players will shoot from which ever end the pucks are
            on, so if there is an uneven number of players, you would have to
            shoot from different sides of the table each time.
        </H2>
        <br />
        <h2>
            After the first player's turn is over, count up all the points and
            that is the score the 2nd player has to beat - no ties. If the second
            player does not beat this score he gets one strike and whatever he
            scored is what the third player has to beat and so on.  The point
            total you are trying to beat is always the player in front of you,
            whether they got a strike or not. If you get 3 strikes, you are out
            and the remaining players continue to play until only one person is
            left who has not received 3 strikes.
        </h2>
        <br>
        <h2>
            In the below diagram, the points total 12, with the blue puck being
            the multiplier. So the next player must score 13 points. If they
            score anything less than 13, say 4, they get a strike and the third
            player is up. The third player must score 5 or more points or they
            will also get a strike.
