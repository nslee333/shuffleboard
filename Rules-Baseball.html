        </h1>
        <H2>
            This is a variation of the game Horse Collar and is played
            in the same way, except that players total their scores and
            determine a winner after nine rounds of play, rather than
            trying to be the first player to reach 51 points.
        </H2>

        <br>
        <h2>
            Players can play in teams of two or against each other in
            a one-on-one situation.  They must use their own set of
            weights and try to keep the weights on the board past the
            designated foul line.
        </h2>

        <br />
        <H2>
            When playing with single players, the person will play all
            weights at one time, trying to get at least one into the
            three-point zone to start the scoring process.
        </H2>

        <br>
        <h2>If no weight lands in the three-point zone, then a player is not allowed to score.</h2>

        <br>
        <h2>
            There are set rules for scoring that determine how many points
            a player or a Team earns based on where the weights end up on
            the board.  It all depends on whether or not the weights are
            touching a line or if they are centered directly between them.
        </h2>

        <br>
        <h2>The game isn’t over until the last player or team has had a chance at the board.</h2>
