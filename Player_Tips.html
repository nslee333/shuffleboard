        <h1 align="Left">Shuffleboard How To Play</h1>
        <H2>There are a number of ways to learn how to play on a shuffleboard 
        table but all players should strive for the three main objectives. 
        Every time you play shuffleboard practice the following:</H2>
        <br>
        <h1 align="Left">1)  THE WELL PLACED PUCK</h1>
        <H2>This is of the most important skills to develop! Learn how to place 
        your puck as far down the board as possible, without having it fall off 
        the far end. This skill is best attained with frequent practice.</H2>
        <br>
        <h1 align="Left">2)  ATTACK OPPONENTS PUCKS</h1>
        <H2>As you learn how to play shuffleboard try to bump and knock off your 
        opponent's highest scoring pucks to prevent them from scoring. This skill 
        is also best attained with frequent practice.</H2>
        <br>
        <h1 align="Left">3)  BLOCKING OR PROTECTING YOUR OWN PUCKS</h1>
        <H2>The method of doing this is called blocking or screening a puck, a 
        familiar tactic seen in football and basketball. Simply place as many of 
        your pucks in front of your highest scoring puck so that your opponent will 
        not be able to knock you off or score. Never place a blocking puck too 
        close to your scoring pucks, because a good opponent will be able to bump 
        them all off the board.</H2>
        <br>
        <br>
        <h1 align="CENTER">LEARN HOW TO PLAY SHUFFLEBOARD USING BOTH HANDS</h1>
        <H2>Shuffleboard requires equal ability with both hands. With a lot of practice 
        you too can learn how to play shuffleboard with equal skill with either hand. 
        Practice by trying to shoot an equal number of shots with either hand. Learning 
        to do this will greatly improve your chances of winning.</H2>
        <br>
        <h1 align="CENTER">HOW TO SHOOT THE PUCKS (OR WEIGHTS) ON A SHUFFLE BOARD</h1>
        <H2>When you first learn how to play shuffleboard you may find it easier to shoot 
        your pucks from the center of the board. However most players will learn it is 
        more accurate to shoot from the edge or side of the board. This way you can use 
        your thumb, index and middle fingers to grip the puck, while you use the third 
        and fourth finger to slide along the edge of the shuffleboard surface. This way 
        the edge of the board will act as a guide to assist in balance and control. You 
        will find that this will give you a much greater degree of accuracy in placing 
        your pucks on the shuffleboard table.</H2>
        <br>
        <h1 align="CENTER">HOW TO PLAY SHUFFLEBOARD USING "ENGLISH" OR (TWIST) IN SHUFFLEBOARD PLAY</h1>
        <H2>The use of English (also known as twist or sidespin) on a puck being delivered on a 
        shuffleboard table greatly improves the accuracy. Similar to its use in billiards, using 
        English gives you more control over the puck's placement and how it will react after it 
        hits another puck. To put English on a shot simply twist your thumb and forefinger away 
        from the wrist and in toward the body as you release the puck. As with most skills, acquiring 
        and developing this one will take a lot of practice. But when properly used, it greatly 
        improves a puck's chances of remaining on the board after it makes contact with an opponent's 
        puck. The English acts as a brake, holding it in place. Very high skilled players use English 
        to hide delivered pucks behind pucks already on the board, thus gaining the advantage of having 
        a just-delivered puck well blocked without further play.</H2>
