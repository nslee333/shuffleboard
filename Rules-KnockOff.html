        <h1 align="Center">Basic Knock Off Game Play</h1>
        <br />
        <H2>
            Knock Off can be played one-on-one or with two teams of two
            people. If playing with two teams, one of each set of partners
            will play at opposite ends of the board and remain there for
            the duration of the game. Games are played until one team scores
            15-points and is deemed the winner. If you want to keep the
            competition going, some will play the game to a score of 21 points.

        <h2>
            In tournament play, the director will designate whether you
            are playing "Short Foul Line” or “Long Foul Line.” Most tournaments
            play with "Short Foul Line" rules, which means any puck past the
            foul line closest to the shooter is considered in-play. In "Long
            Foul Line" Knock Off game, the pucks are considered in-play when
            they are past the foul line on the opposite end of the board. It’s
            important to note that most home games are played on 14-foot tables
            or shorter that only have one foul line in the center of the table
            so you would play a single foul line rule which would put pucks in
            play only if they are past the center line or only foul line on a
            shorter table.

        <br />
        <h2>
            Play may start from either end of the board, but the shooting
            order and weight color are decided by a coin toss. The winner
            of the flip may elect to choose the color of the shuffleboard
            puck or the hammer. Named for the person who has the last shot
            of the round, the hammer is considered an advantage since you
            have the final opportunity to knock off an opponent’s puck.
            The player’s alternate shots until the round is over and all
            four weights have been thrown across the shuffleboard table.
        </h2>

        <br />
        <H2>
            The team or player who scored points on the previous round
            must shoot first on the next round. If no points are scored
            on the preceding round (I.E.: All weights are knocked off)
            than the hammer changes hands. Play continues in this manner
            until one team reaches the designated points usually 15 points.
        </H2>

        <h1 align="Center">How To Score In Knock Off</h1>
        <br />
        <h2>
            In each round of Knock Off, only one player scores points. The
            team who has thrown their puck closest to the end of the board
            scores all the points in that round. Only the pucks that are
            ahead of your opponent's deepest weight are added together for
            the score for that round. A weight scores one-point if it is
            located between the designated foul line and the two-point
            line. Weights completely across the two or three line likewise
            count for the allotted number of points for that section of the table.
        </h2>

        <br>
        <h2>
            To judge if a weight is completely over the line it should be
            viewed from above (i.e., look down over the top of the weight).
            The entire weight must be over the line for it to count as the
            next higher point value. If any portion of the weight is hanging
            over the end of the board in the three-point section, it’s called
            a “hanger" and counts as four-points. If you’re having trouble
            calling a hanger, check by holding a weight flat to the edge
            of the board and dragging it along the back end of the board.
            If it hits the hanger the puck then it is worth the entire four-points.
