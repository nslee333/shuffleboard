            This is a great shuffleboard game for a single player to play,
            as it does not require an opponent. The player playing tries
            to shoot their highest score, and is a test of both lagging
            ability, as well as sticking
        </H2>

        <h2>
            There is very minimal strategy in this game, but it is great
            for players learning how to knock off weights at particular
            locations on the board.
        </h2>

        <h2>
            Players shoot eight frames down and back, so four are shot
            from each end. For each frame, another person sets up three
            weights on the board for the player to try to knock them off
            and then lag the rest of their weights.
        </h2>
        <br />
        <H2>
            The weights are set up in varying areas across the board,
            which is great for players who want to work on their skill
            and need practice in knocking off certain weights from various areas.
        </H2>
        <br />
        <h2>
            Additionally, since this game is played by just one person,
            it is a great way to practice without the incredible stress
            that some players feel when they are in competition with
            other players and can easily help players improve their
            game to play on a team.
